# README Todo: Incorrect or Unsupported Claims

This list tracks README statements that are inaccurate, misleading, or too
strong after comparing the current code, `papers/`, and AlphaEvolve sources.

## Feature Claims

- [ ] Keep README LLM budget/replay claims scoped to current synchronous
  restore boundaries.
  - Spec evidence: AlphaEvolve-scale reproduction needs compute-budgeted model
    scheduling, replayable run accounting, and enough provider evidence to
    distinguish resumed controller state from replayed provider outputs.
  - Current evidence: README now documents live synchronous
    provider-attempt/token/configured-cost/latency stops, restorable runtime
    budget snapshots, `controller_budget_events.jsonl` replay, and
    full-runtime restore validation. It also documents strict call-ledger
    provider-failure summaries and restorable scheduler failure-policy state,
    while still marking live provider pricing/default-rate capture beyond
    configured estimates, provider-output/raw-payload replay, cross-run
    provider-failure policy proof, and async/pending-work budget composition as
    open.
  - Required result: once provider-output replay, async/pending-work budget
    composition, live pricing/default-rate capture beyond configured
    estimates, or cross-run provider-failure quarantine/resume proof lands,
    update the README and matching code/paper TODO entries together so the
    README neither underclaims current synchronous budget replay and provider
    failure-policy evidence nor overclaims full AlphaEvolve-style replay.

- [ ] Keep README archive restore claims scoped to current archive-content
  restore.
  - Spec evidence: AlphaEvolve-style long-running evolutionary search needs
    reproducible population state and clear boundaries for migration-order
    replay versus snapshot restore.
  - Current evidence: README now says full archive cell/island contents can be
    restored from manifest snapshots plus checked accepted-history rows, while
    ordered migration-event replay remains audit-only rather than a MAP-Elites
    restore engine.
  - Required result: when ordered migration-event replay or async
    controller/pending-work resume lands, update README archive sections,
    roadmap, papers index, and code/paper TODO entries together so they do not
    underclaim archive-content restore or overclaim migration replay.
